# context_matrix
The context matrix is a continuously developing database designed to categorise and explore the three main biosystem function contexts (synthetic construct, host, environment) and their net effect on the function of engineered biosystems.<br/>

The context matrix is now [published in Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2022.954707/full). <br/>
